# E_Tools
**NOTE E_TOOLS ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS!!!**
E_Tools are some small programs to run from command line and they might even make your life a little easier
To be able to use these commands from command line press the windows button type in "environment variables"
click on "Edit the system environment variables" then click "Environment Variables"
then scroll down to "Path" in the "system variables" section, then click "Edit", then click "New"
next, click "Browse..." navigate to wherever the E_Tools folder is stored and and click "OK" with the folder selected.
Finally exit the environment variables window and now you should be able to execute these files from command prompt :)
